## Installation

Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/juiceboxcode/unlock_us) and run the `Unlock Us Setup X.X.X.exe` file. You may get antivirus warnings, because this program hooks into the Among Us process to read game data.

If you can, you should use a private server by deploying [this repository](https://github.com/juiceboxcode/unlock_us).
